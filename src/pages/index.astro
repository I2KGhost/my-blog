        <h1>The I2KGhost Protocol</h1>
        <p>
          Hey, you made it. This is <em>The I2KGhost Protocol</em> — my no-fluff corner of the internet.
          I’m Ivaylo (aka <strong>I2KGhost</strong>), and this place is for the curious ones.

          Geeks and nerds who like to tinker with electronics, automate the boring stuff, poke at AI models,
          and occasionally break things just to see what happens — you’re home.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yes, fantasy fans — you’re part of the crew, too. Myth-soaked worlds, dragons, and creative experiments
          are very much on the menu.
