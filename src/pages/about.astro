    <p>Hey, I’m Ivaylo 👋</p>

    <p>Online, most people know me as I2KGhost.
    The story behind that name is… well, a journey in itself.</p>

    <p>Back in my teenage years, I went through a lot of nicknames. At the time, they all sounded cool, but eventually you grow up and realize… maybe they don’t sound that cool anymore. 😂</p>

    <p>So, I decided to pick something new. My first idea was I2K, basically a shortened version of my own names. It worked fine on most sites, but some platforms didn’t accept nicknames with only three characters. That meant I either had to invent something entirely new or add to what I already had.</p>

    <p>Since I’ve always liked shadows, ghosts, and mysterious stuff, I added Ghost to the end — keeping I2K but making it longer and more unique. And that’s how I2KGhost was born.</p>

    <h2>My path into tech 🖥️</h2>

    <p>My first real experiments with code go all the way back to 2007–2008, when I joined a college for computer networks. At that time, I wasn’t exactly fascinated — honestly, I had no idea what all those codes were for.</p>

    <p>Much later, I stumbled into programming again when the first private programming university opened in my country. Back then, all their courses were free and open to everyone. That’s when I got hooked — first on Java (mostly because of Android, and I understood almost nothing), then briefly C, C++, C#, and finally Python.</p>

    <p>Python stuck with me. Even today, I can’t say I know it perfectly, but I can write and understand simple code. Somewhere in between, I also tried my hand at web design.</p>

    <h2>From code to fantasy worlds 📚🐉</h2>

    <p>After my programming adventures, I got the idea to write a fantasy novel. Around that time, Game of Thrones had just come out, and I thought, “I’ll be the next George R.R. Martin.”
    The working title was The Night of the Raven (yes, Gothic fans will get the reference 😅).</p>

    <p>That book idea stayed with me for years — and still does — but with a new name: Drekoria. Funny enough, Drekoria started as the name of an empire in the story, but eventually became the name of the entire project.</p>

    <h2>The Drekoria Universe 🎙️</h2>

    <p>Today, Drekoria is a multi-project brand:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>🌌 <b>Drekoria</b> – where myths inspire the future. A nature-inspired fantasy world full of lore, characters, and history.</li>
      <li>🎧 <b>Chronicles of Drekoria Podcast</b> – for artists, writers, and creators. Tips, tricks, creative discussions, and inspiring stories.</li>
      <li>⚡ <b>The Voice of Drekoria</b> – tech-focused podcast about AI, robotics, and programming.</li>
      <li>📷 <b>Drekoria Tech</b> – Instagram branch of The Voice of Drekoria, sharing tools, experiments, and AI creations.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And because I love building things, I’m also working on an Etsy store that combines both the creative and tech sides of Drekoria with unique products.</p>

    <h2>5 Random Facts About Me</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Favorite drink</b> – Red wine if we’re talking alcohol, lemonade (any flavor) if not.</li>
      <li><b>Most absurd thing I’ve automated</b> – My heater. Yep, I can turn it on from my phone while coming home in winter. 😅</li>
      <li><b>Favorite game</b> – Many, but World of Warcraft will always have a place in my heart. Also Gothic — countless sleepless nights spent there.</li>
      <li><b>If the internet disappeared for a year</b> – Just give me books and don’t bother me. I’ll survive. 😂</li>
      <li><b>Favorite keyboard sound</b> – I used to like loud blue switches for gaming, but now I prefer quiet linear switches. I type more than I game these days.</li>
